# Pinecone is a managed cloud vector database service.
# There is no local docker container to run.
#
# To use Pinecone with pyvectordb, you need:
# 1. A Pinecone account (https://www.pinecone.io/)
# 2. An API key from your Pinecone dashboard
# 3. Create an index or let pyvectordb create one for you
#
# Environment variables to set in your .env file:
# PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
# PINECONE_HOST=your_index_host (optional, can be inferred from index_name)
#
# Example usage:
# from pyvectordb.pinecone import PineconeDB
# from pyvectordb.distance_function import DistanceFunction
#
# vector_db = PineconeDB(
#     api_key="your_api_key",
#     index_name="my-index",
#     dimension=1536,  # Required to create new index
#     distance_function=DistanceFunction.COSINE,
# )
